# Smart Disaster Response Platform

This repository contains the Smart Disaster Response Platform — a Next.js/TypeScript app used for managing alerts, volunteers, and related services.

This README was added locally before pushing to the remote repository. Follow these steps to synchronize with GitHub:

1. Inspect remote: `git remote -v` and `git fetch origin`
2. Merge or overwrite: choose to merge remote history or force-push to replace remote.
3. Push your chosen branch: `git push -u origin main` (or `--force` to overwrite).

If you're unsure, prefer merging with `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories` to preserve remote history.
